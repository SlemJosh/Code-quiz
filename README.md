## Code Quiz

## Description
This project was all about creating a quiz from the ground up.  I was not given any code for this project, so it all had to start with me.  That might have been a 
challenge before, but I'm really starting to get a hang of the html and CSS stuff.  So that part goes very quickly, then it was just about researching ways of 
making sure I hit all the requested criteria with the javascript.  One of the things I noted very early on, was that my styling choice could make my site
virtually impossible to use if a user was to have certain features.  I've noticed myself that using dark mode has some sites not working at all.  Now sure I can just
turn off dark mode, but I thought rather than make the user have to do the same, I would implement some styles that would help it be display regardless of that choice. 
That being said, something that I've really been getting an interest in is figuring out if there is a way to build into the code ways for that to change.

Back to the code itself, I used some examples given for questions, and then found some other additional questions to add to the quiz.  Formatting them on the script 
was one of the first things to do, and it set the narrative for a large part of how the rest of the scripting and page would work. We made a box, and told it that on 
line 1 there was this, line 2, that, and so on and so forth.  It allowed for functions to use those lines to not only display the questions in a format I wanted, but to 
also change the game or even display different information.

A big challenge for me was figuring out how to implement keeping scores and displaying them in a user friendly fashion.  I haven't tried it before, but this project,
I dove into chat GPT for some assistance, and it really helped me learned how to make things work.

Lots of checking my code with ChatGPT and asking some basic questions helped me figure out how to write my own code and make sure that it was operational.
